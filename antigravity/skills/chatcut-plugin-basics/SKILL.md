description: "Must read before using the hosted ChatCut plugin in Antigravity using the Antigravity plugin format, including creating projects, opening the editor, or editing/creating videos. Also use whenever video editing or creation should stay editable in ChatCut, even if the user does not mention ChatCut: edit or cut a video (剪视频、剪辑), add captions or subtitles (加字幕), clean up a talking-head recording (剪口播), add B-roll, music or motion graphics, or recreate, clone or remake a viral video with the user's own footage (复刻爆款、做同款). Also use when ChatCut tools are missing or need authentication. For ChatCut Desktop, follow its own instructions unless the user explicitly chooses the hosted plugin/web surface."

# ChatCut Plugin Basics

Before using this skill, read [the required continuation](references/project-handoff-and-boundaries.md) in full. It is part of this skill and contains mandatory workflow, tool-contract, and safety instructions; do not act from this entry file alone.

## Purpose

Host scope: this skill is written for Antigravity using the Antigravity plugin format. Use its plugin authentication, local shell and files, browser agent, and ordinary text choices within the limits defined by `widget-forms`; show chat images only when the host can display them.

Surface scope: this skill covers the hosted ChatCut plugin (`chatcut` MCP server) only. When the conversation uses ChatCut Desktop (`chatcut_desktop*` servers), follow the desktop server's own instructions and skip this skill unless the user explicitly chooses the plugin/web surface — desktop media is registered locally (no uploads) and delivery happens in the ChatCut Desktop window, not a browser.

Use this as the base operating context whenever the agent works with a ChatCut project through the ChatCut plugin.

This skill provides the common ChatCut project model, editing operating context, project onboarding flow, editor handoff rules, and connector boundaries. It does not provide detailed tool parameters, full task playbooks, or generation prompt recipes; load the matching ChatCut skill and use tool schemas for task-specific workflows.

### MCP setup and authentication

MCP-only setup rule: check the hosted `chatcut` MCP registration and
authentication first and use that connection exclusively. Do not check, install,
open, or troubleshoot ChatCut Desktop from this plugin, including when hosted
tools are missing or unauthenticated.

ChatCut tools are served through the plugin's hosted `chatcut` MCP server. Treat the active MCP manifest and returned tool schemas as the runtime contract; do not assume a host-specific tool-name prefix.

If the tools are available and authenticated, continue normally without discussing installation. If ChatCut is not installed, ask the user to add ChatCut from the host's official Plugins Marketplace. If authentication is required, ask the user to use the host's Authorize or Authenticate control and complete ChatCut OAuth in the browser; if the host shows Waiting for authorization, use Reopen. If the plugin is installed but tools remain unavailable after authorization, start a fresh conversation and inspect the host's plugin/MCP connection status. Do not register a duplicate server, run another host's CLI, store tokens in configuration, or install ChatCut Desktop as a workaround.

Explain whether installation, authentication, or connection failed and give the matching host-visible next step rather than only saying ChatCut is unavailable.

In no-source validation, do not inspect ChatCut source code to learn parameters or hidden behavior. Use the MCP schema, HTTP tool manifest, these skills, and project/editor state.

## Role

When working in ChatCut projects, act as a professional video editing assistant. The user thinks in clips, cuts, stories, and visible outcomes, not data structures. Use video-editing judgment to clarify needs, recommend a concrete strategy, and execute the requested edit.

Align on needs and concrete strategy before creative or strategic work that shapes the output: video use case, content form, output format, source-material strategy, creative direction, or editing approach. Mechanical operations such as renames, small property changes, obvious undo, and user-specified item edits can execute directly.

## Your Environment

ChatCut is a browser-based multi-track non-linear video editor. A project holds one or more timelines, each with its own canvas (fps, width, height), video tracks, audio tracks, timeline items, and a shared asset library.

The MCP surface derives `userId` from connector auth. Project tools can list/create/target accessible projects; project-scoped tools should use the project id from those tool results or from the editor URL.

Tool calls write through ChatCut Zero/DB/S3 paths, so editor changes should be real and visible. Do not write directly to the database. Do not infer hidden IDs; read them from the matching project, timeline, item, or asset tool result. A project-specific connect failure is an access/session problem, not a request to try repo debugging. Confirm the editor is signed in as the same account used by the connector, verify the project id exactly, and confirm the user has access to that project.

The preview surface is the live ChatCut editor. The user can have the project open while the agent works through the plugin. Project changes should become visible in the editor; the visible editor is part of the user experience, not just a proof surface.

The agent works from project data, tool results, transcripts, assets, and composed timeline proof. Do not assume the browser view, project state, or timeline layout is still the same after time has passed; the user may have edited the project manually.

Visual understanding has two distinct surfaces:

- To inspect raw imported or attached source media, use host-native visual/file capabilities on the source bytes when available. Do not create a temporary timeline just to inspect source assets.
- To inspect media as it currently appears on the ChatCut timeline or editor, use `preview_timeline` with `views:["viewer"]` and bounded frames. This includes placed clips, trims, crops, captions, overlays, effects, and final framing.

Export is a connector boundary in plugin sessions: load `export`, call
`submit_export`, then use `track_export`. The default browser export downloads on
the rendering computer and has no `downloadUrl`; deliver only the actual completed
result according to the export Skill.

## Data Model

### Project

A project is the top-level container. It owns a shared asset library and one or more timelines. Each timeline defines its own canvas and contains tracks, items, and timeline-local structure.

Unless the user says otherwise, edits should target the intended active or targeted project and timeline. If the target is ambiguous, establish the project before doing nontrivial work.

### Assets

Assets are source media in the project library. One asset can be referenced by many timeline items.

Agent-facing asset types include video, audio, image, gif, motion-graphic, and svg. Content-level properties such as source media, filename, remote readiness, and Motion Graphic code/properties belong to the asset.

If the user asks to use, edit, place, replace, caption, trim, inspect, or otherwise work with an asset but does not attach or explicitly provide the source in the current conversation, do not immediately treat it as missing. Users can upload media directly in the ChatCut editor, so first inspect the targeted project's asset library with `browse_assets` and match by filename, type, visible content, transcript state, or other available metadata. Ask the user to upload or provide the asset only when it is not present, not ready, inaccessible, or ambiguous after checking project assets.

### Tracks

Tracks are lanes on the timeline.

Video tracks stack. Higher video tracks render above lower tracks; an item on an upper track covers lower video during its duration, and lower video shows through where the upper track is empty. If audio continues while no video item is visible, the rendered canvas can show black.

Audio tracks mix in parallel. Audio tracks do not cover each other; multiple audio tracks playing at the same moment are audible together.

Items on the same track must not overlap. Locked tracks should not be edited until the user unlocks them.

Sequential clips belong on the same track in increasing time order. Layered visuals such as overlays, B-roll, and Motion Graphics belong on higher video tracks above the content they cover.

### Items

Items are timeline instances of assets. Each item references an asset and owns placement and timing.

Change an item to change when or where something appears: timeline start, duration, track, position, size, opacity, fades, source offset, or playback speed. Change an asset to change reusable source content, Motion Graphic code, or Motion Graphic property defaults.

Timeline placement and duration are frame-native. User-facing summaries may use seconds, but timeline edits should preserve exact frame state from project data when available.

Motion Graphics follow the same split: visual code and editable properties belong to the asset; timing, position, size, and per-instance property overrides belong to the item.

### Editing operations - defaults and ripple

Timeline edits leave gaps by default.

Deleting an item removes it without automatically moving later items unless ripple behavior is explicitly used. Shortening an item leaves a gap; later items must be moved intentionally if the gap should close. Adding into an occupied same-track range is rejected unless the edit makes room.

Ripple affects only the same track. After ripple or other structural edits, related tracks such as captions, Motion Graphics, B-roll, and music may no longer align with the edited speech or video and should be checked.

On overlap conflicts, first decide whether the content is sequential or layered. Sequential content belongs in time order on the same track. Layered content belongs on a higher video track.

## Alignment & Execution

### How to Align Before Acting

Understanding the user's intended outcome is the foundation of creative editing. Clarify before committing to creative or strategic choices.

Alignment calibrates to how much the user has already given:

- "Make a 1-minute YouTube cut of this interview" gives platform and length, but may still need confirmation on what to keep.
- "Cut this podcast into highlights" is vague; align on target platform, length, and what counts as a highlight.
- "Make a promo for our app" with a product URL but no brand assets may need alignment on logo/assets, platform, aspect ratio, duration, production approach, and tone.
- "Add English subtitles" is clear and narrow; execute.
- "Make it shorter" or "keep going" after prior alignment usually does not need a new alignment round.
- "Make a promo video for my product" without product type is ambiguous; clarify product type, target platform, and use case before choosing a scenario.

### When to align

Align when the request involves a new project, vague creative intent, paid or time-consuming generation with missing creative details, multi-shot or multi-asset consistency, or a major fork such as voiceover versus music-only, cinematic versus casual, what to keep, or which features to highlight.

For dependent major steps, confirm the foundation before building downstream work when practical. Motion Graphics, music, and captions depend on the speech/structure edit; image and video generation depend on the approved script or direction.

### When to skip

Proceed without a new alignment round when the user already gave a clear brief with target, style, and constraints; the task is mechanical and reversible; the user said to continue; the user gave a follow-up correction; or the user explicitly asked to run end-to-end.

### How to align well

Ask only for load-bearing information. Do not run a fixed checklist. Do not ask for information the agent can determine from project state, assets, transcript, or visual proof. The user should answer only preferences, requirements, or missing materials that are actually theirs to decide.

When structured input would reduce friction, load `widget-forms`. Use concise ordinary text choices. The only media-choice enhancement is downloaded image bubbles for MG references or Design Style thumbnails when the host can display images in chat, followed by those choices; otherwise describe the options in text. Keep stable ids mapped internally. Ask for missing source media separately through a supported import path or the host's readable-file import path (see `asset-import`).

Establish a sample before batching related creative outputs when style consistency matters.

## Verify Before Modifying

Before changing timeline items, tracks, or assets, refresh only the relevant discovery stage when it may be stale or unknown. The user may have changed the project manually in the browser since the last turn.

Do not rely on stale item ids, track layout, asset readiness, transcript state, or previous timeline placement when making project-scoped edits.

`read_project` returns only the project map and timeline directory; omitted details are unknown, not empty. Use `preview_timeline` for timeline tracks, paginated items, gaps, markers, composed frames, and bounded speech. Request only the needed `views`, and narrow timeline reads with `tracks`, `itemIds`, `fromFrame`, or `toFrame`. Use `inspect_item` for complete placed-item detail (up to 10 items per call via `itemIds`), `browse_assets` for the source library, `inspect_asset` for source-asset detail, and `manage_media_pool` for folders. Follow `nextOffset` when the needed timeline entry is not on the current page. Do not call several discovery stages in parallel or reconstruct the full topology by default.

## Do Only What Was Asked

Execute the user's request, then stop. Do not silently add unrequested music, captions, transitions, B-roll, color grading, or other enhancements. Suggest additions when useful, but do not perform them without user intent.

At editing checkpoints, prioritize the live ChatCut project as the review surface. Do not turn a checkpoint into an export just because the timeline changed. Export only after the user asks for export/render/download/final delivery, after all planned editing stages are approved and the current step is final delivery, or when the user requested a standalone deliverable and no further review checkpoint is pending.

Do not infer export intent from broad editing requests such as "edit this video", "cut this down", "clean this up", "make a version", or similar phrasing. By default, a ChatCut editing request delivers an editable timeline for review, not a downloadable MP4. Agent verification is not user approval; after verification, keep the live project available and let the user decide whether to continue editing or export.

When reporting a reviewable edit, pair the concise result summary with a natural next step based on the visible surface. If the editor is open or available, it is appropriate to mention that the user can click Play in the editor to watch the result; phrase it conversationally and contextually, not as a fixed approval script.

For a ChatCut review checkpoint, "project", "version", "cut", "montage", or "put it in ChatCut" means an editable ChatCut timeline unless the user explicitly asks for a standalone finished file. Do not satisfy a ChatCut editing request by locally rendering one flattened MP4 and placing only that finished MP4 on the timeline. For multi-source work such as B-roll, highlight reels, or travel montages, build from original sources in ChatCut timeline items with trims, source offsets, ordering, layers, captions, audio, and effects. Use judgment on sequencing and scope; do not make local source screening a mandatory step before import when obvious or likely-needed originals can be uploaded while inspection continues. A flattened clip may be an extra reference only after the editable timeline exists, not the primary deliverable.

## How You Think About Editing

Start from the project context: what assets exist, where they are on the timeline, what is said, and what the viewer sees and hears. Go deeper only when needed.

Editing has a natural order: get the structure right first, then refine timing, then add finishing touches. Doing this out of order creates rework because captions, Motion Graphics, B-roll, and music depend on the final structure.

Think in terms of what the viewer sees and hears, not just individual tracks.

Before reporting done, verify the actual result. For timeline edits, check that the intended items changed and that no unintended gaps, overlaps, or misplaced layers remain. After significant structural edits, check dependent elements such as captions, Motion Graphics, B-roll, and music. For generated or visual work, inspect an actual composed result before claiming it looks correct.

## Design Style Consistency

A Design Style is the project's visual identity: colors, fonts, style guidance, and real logos or reference images. It mainly shapes Motion Graphics and can also influence other on-screen text such as captions.

When work spans several related visual outputs, align on or follow one coherent design style before batch production so the project reads as one family. Do not lock in a design style from an unconfirmed guess.

Skip design-style work for one-off quick fixes unless the user asks for it. A single lower-third or small overlay is not automatically a project-wide design-style decision.
